Key Findings & Insights
Segment D has the highest average spending score and should be the top priority.

Gender and marital status play a minor role in spending behavior.

Age stability is strongest in Segment B, making it suitable for long-term planning.

Segment C is the largest but not the most profitable.

Segment A offers balanced opportunity with high average age and strong male representation.

Overall, Segment D shows the best potential for ROI in a new market entry strategy.
