# Customer Segmentation SQL Analysis

## 📌 Project Description  
This project analyzes customer demographics and spending behaviors using SQL. The goal is to identify valuable customer segments to guide data-driven marketing strategies and expansion decisions. It addresses the challenge of prioritizing target groups based on size, profitability, and demographic stability.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- SQL (SQLite Online)  
- Excel (data cleaning and exploration)  
- Power BI *(planned – placeholder link below)*

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights  
- Segment D has the highest average spending score and should be the top priority.  
- Gender and marital status play a minor role in spending behavior.  
- Age stability is strongest in Segment B, making it suitable for long-term planning.  
- Segment C is the largest but not the most profitable.  
- Segment A offers balanced opportunity with high average age and strong male representation.  
- Overall, Segment D shows the best potential for ROI in a new market entry strategy.
